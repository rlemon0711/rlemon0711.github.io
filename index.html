            <h2>Royal D. Lemon</h2>
            <p>
As a proud alumnus of Edward Hynes Parkview School, I carry with me the foundational values and education that have shaped my journey. My time at Parkview was marked by enriching experiences and supportive mentors who instilled in me a passion for learning and personal growth. Now, as a current student at St. Augustine High School, I am excited to build upon this strong foundation. At St. Augustine, I am embracing new challenges and opportunities that further develop my skills and broaden my horizons. The transition from Parkview to St. Augustine represents not just a change in schools, but a continuous journey of academic excellence and character development. </p>
